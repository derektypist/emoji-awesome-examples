# Emoji Awesome Examples

The purpose of the exercise is to provide examples of using Emoji Awesome.  It is in a similar way to
using Font Awesome.

## UX

The Emoji Awesome has three categories - Electrical Devices, Health Items and Paris.

Electrical Devices are things around the home (e.g. radio).
Health Items include food (e.g. apple) and the pill.
Paris includes some of the things I have been doing there (e.g. tram).

As a user, I expect the emoji to be next to the word. For example `Apple üçè`.
